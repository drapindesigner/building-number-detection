FIXES
===============================================================================
Fixed a critical runtime error in Task 3 and improved the handling of negative
images (images with no detections/segmentations) across Tasks 2 and 3.

===============================================================================
FIXES APPLIED
===============================================================================

1. Fixed collect_images() function (perception/io_utils.py:43)

   BEFORE:
   - Raised FileNotFoundError when no images found in directory
   - Caused Task 3 to crash on empty subdirectories

   AFTER:
   - Returns empty list [] when no images found
   - Allows calling code to handle empty directories gracefully


2. Improved Task 2: Skip directory creation for negative images (task2.py:70-83)

   BEFORE:
   - Created subdirectory for every input image, even with no segments
   - Left empty directories (e.g., bn1/) in output

   AFTER:
   - Only creates subdirectory when segments are detected
   - Cleans up stale empty directories from previous runs
   - Skips directory creation for images with zero segments


3. Improved Task 3: Skip directory creation for empty inputs (task3.py:110-123)

   BEFORE:
   - Created subdirectory even when no character images provided
   - Left empty directories in output

   AFTER:
   - Only creates subdirectory when character images exist
   - Cleans up stale empty directories from previous runs
   - Skips directory creation for empty image sets
